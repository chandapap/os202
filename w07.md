1.[Synchronization](https://www.guru99.com/process-synchronization.html)<br>
Process Synchronization is the task of coordinating the execution of process in a way thah no two processes can have access to the same shared data and resources.
it is specially needed in a multi-process system when multiple processes are running together, and more than one processes try to gain access to the same shared resource or data at the same time.
This can lead to the inconsistency of share data . So the change mad by one process not necessarily reflected whne other processes accessed the same shared data. To avoid this type of inconsistency of data, the processes need to be synchronized with each other.

2.[Basis of Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/)<br>
On the basis of synchronizztion,processes are categorized as one of the following two types:
- Independent Process: Execution of one process does not affects the execution of other processes.
- Cooperative Process: Execution of one process affects the execution of other process.

3.[Race Condition](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/race-condition-critical-section-and-semaphore)<br>
A race condition is a situation that may occur inside a critical section. This happens when ther result of multiple thread execution in critical section differs according to the order in which the threads execute.
Race conditions in critical sections can be avoided if the critical section is treated as an atomic instruction. Also, proper thread synchronization using locks or atomic variables can prevent race conditions.

4.[The Critical Section Proble](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-critical-section-problem)<br>
Critical Section is the part of a program which tries to access shared resource may be any resource in a computer like a memory location, Data structure, CPU or any IO device.
The critical section cannot be executed by more than one process at the same time; operating system faces the difficulties in allowing and disallowing the processes from entering the critical section.
The critical section probelm is used to design a set of protocols which can ensure that the Race condition among the processes will never arise.
In order to synchronize the cooperative processes, our main task is to solve the critical section problem. We need to provide a solution in such a way that the following conditions can be satisfied.
