#Top 10 list of Week 07
<br>

1.[Synchronization](https://www.guru99.com/process-synchronization.html)<br>
Process Synchronization is the task of coordinating the execution of process in a way thah no two processes can have access to the same shared data and resources.
it is specially needed in a multi-process system when multiple processes are running together, and more than one processes try to gain access to the same shared resource or data at the same time.
This can lead to the inconsistency of share data . So the change mad by one process not necessarily reflected whne other processes accessed the same shared data. To avoid this type of inconsistency of data, the processes need to be synchronized with each other.

2.[Basis of Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/)<br>
On the basis of synchronizztion,processes are categorized as one of the following two types:
- Independent Process: Execution of one process does not affects the execution of other processes.
- Cooperative Process: Execution of one process affects the execution of other process.

3.[Race Condition](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/race-condition-critical-section-and-semaphore)<br>
A race condition is a situation that may occur inside a critical section. This happens when ther result of multiple thread execution in critical section differs according to the order in which the threads execute.
Race conditions in critical sections can be avoided if the critical section is treated as an atomic instruction. Also, proper thread synchronization using locks or atomic variables can prevent race conditions.

4.[The Critical Section Proble](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-critical-section-problem)<br>
Critical Section is the part of a program which tries to access shared resource may be any resource in a computer like a memory location, Data structure, CPU or any IO device.
The critical section cannot be executed by more than one process at the same time; operating system faces the difficulties in allowing and disallowing the processes from entering the critical section.
The critical section probelm is used to design a set of protocols which can ensure that the Race condition among the processes will never arise.
In order to synchronize the cooperative processes, our main task is to solve the critical section problem. We need to provide a solution in such a way that the following conditions can be satisfied.

5.[Solution of Critical Section Problem](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization#)<br>
A solution to the critical section problem must satisfy the following three conditions:

- Mutual Exclusion
Out of group of cooperating processes, only one process can be in its critical section at a given point of time.

- Progress
If no process is in its critical section and if one or more threads want to execute their critical section then any one of these threads must be allowed to get into its criticalsection. then any one of these threads must be allowed to get into its critical section.

- Bounded Waiting 
After a process makes a request for getting into its critical section, there is a limit for how may other processes can get into their critical section, before this process's request is granted. So after the limit is reached, system must grant the process permission to get into its critical section.

6.[Semaphore](https://www.tutorialandexample.com/semaphore-in-operating-system/)<br>
Semaphore is defined as an integer variable which is used to solve the problem of the critical section in process syncchronization. In semaphore, there is two types of atomic operations, and that operations are wait and signal.
- Wait
In wait operation, the argument 'S' value is decrement by 1 if the value of the 'S' variable is positive. If the value of the argument variable 'S' is zero or negative, no operation is performed.
- Signal
In Signal atomic operation, the value of teh argument variable 'S' is incremented

7.[Deadlock](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/deadlock)<br>
A deadlock is a situation in which two computer programs sharing the same resource are effectively preventing each other from accessing the resource, resulting in both programs ceasing to function.
The earliest computer operating systems ran only one program at a time. All of the resources of the system were available to this one program. Later, operating systems ran multiple programs at once, interleaving them. Programs were required to specify in advance what resources the needed so that they could avoid conflicts with other programs running at the sam ttime. Eventually some operating systems offered dynamic allocation of resources. Programs could request furhter allocations of resources after they had begun running. This led to the problem of the deadlock.

8.[Deadlock Characterization](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/deadlock-characterization)<br>
A deadlock occurs if the four Coffman conditions hold true. But thes conditions are not mutually exclusive.

- Mutual Exclusion
There should be resource that can only be held by one process at atime.

- Hold and Wait
A process can hold multiple resources and still request more resources from other processes which are holding them.

- No Preemption
A resource cannot be preempeted from a process by force. A process can only release a resource voluntarily.

- Circular Wait
A process is waiting for the resource held by the second process, which is waiting for the resource held by third process and so on, toll the last process is waiting for a resource held by the first process.

9.[Banker's Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system/)<br>
Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm. This algorithm test for safety simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts ofall resources, then makes an "s-state" check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
In simple terms, it checks if allocation of any resource will lead to deadlock or not, OR is it safe to allocate a resource to a process and if not then resource is not allocatedd to that process. Determining a safe sequence(even if there is only 1) will assure that system will not go into deadlock.
