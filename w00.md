# Top 10 List of Week 00


1. Operating System Structures
    - Operating systems provide an environment for execution of programs and services to programs and users
    - One set of operating-system services provides functions that are helpful to the user:
      > User interface - Almost all operating systems have a user interface (UI).
      > Varies between Command-Line (CLI), Graphics User Interface (GUI),  touch-screen,  Batch
      > Program execution - The system must be able to load a program into memory and to run that program, end execution, either normally or abnormally (indicating error)
      > I/O operations -  A running program may require I/O, which may involve a file or an I/O device
      > File-system manipulation -  The file system is of particular interest. Programs need to read and write files and directories, create and delete them, search them, list file Information, permission management.

2. Threads & Concurency
    - Single and Multithreaded Processes
    - Single and Multithreaded Server Arcchitecture
    - Concurrency vs. Parallelism
    - User Threads and Kernel Threads
  
3. CPU Scheduling
    - Maximum CPU utilization obtained with multiprogramming
    - CPU–I/O Burst Cycle – Process execution consists of a cycle of CPU execution and I/O wait
    - CPU burst followed by I/O burst
    - CPU burst distribution is of main concern

  
4. Main Memory
    - Program must be brought (from disk)  into memory and placed within a process for it to be run
    - Main memory and registers are only storage CPU can access directly
    - Memory unit only sees a stream of:
        > addresses + read requests, or 
        > address + data and write requests
    - Register access is done in one CPU clock (or less)
    - Main memory can take many cycles, causing a stall
    - Cache sits between main memory and CPU registers
    - Protection of memory required to ensure correct operation

5. Mass Storage Structure
    - Bulk of secondary storage for modern computers is hard disk drives (HDDs) and nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices
    - HDDs spin platters of magnetically-coated material under moving read-write heads
      > Drives rotate at 60 to 250 times per second
      > Transfer rate is rate at which data flow between drive and computer
      > Positioning time (random-access time) is time to move disk arm to desired cylinder (seek time) and time for desired sector to rotate under the disk head (rotational latency)
      > Head crash results from disk head making contact with the disk surface  -- That’s bad
    - Disks can be removable


6. I/O Systems
    - I/O management is a major component of operating system design and operation
      > Important aspect of computer operation
      > I/O devices vary greatly
      > Various methods to control them
      > Performance management 
      > New types of devices frequent
    - Ports, busses, device controllers connect to various devices
    - Device drivers encapsulate device details
      > Present uniform device-access interface to I/O subsystem

7. Security
    Security Violation Categories
      - Breach of confidentiality
        > Unauthorized reading of data
      - Breach of integrity
        > Unauthorized modification of data
      - Breach of availability
        > Unauthorized destruction of data
      - Theft of service
        > Unauthorized use of resources
      - Denial of service (DOS)
        > Prevention of legitimate use

8. Protection
    Guiding principle – principle of least privilege
      - Programs, users and systems should be given just enough privileges to perform their tasks
      - Properly set permissions can limit damage if entity has a bug, gets abused
      - Can be static (during life of system, during life of process) 
      - Or dynamic (changed by process as needed) – domain switching, privilege escalation
      - Compartmentalization a derivative concept regarding access to data 
        > Process of protecting each individual system component through the use of specific permissions and access restrictions
        
9. Deadlocks
    - Deadlock can arise if four conditions hold simultaneously.
      > Mutual exclusion:  only one process at a time can use a resource
      > Hold and wait:  a process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes
      > No preemption:  a resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it, after that process has completed its task
      > Circular wait:  there exists a set {P0, P1, …, Pn} of waiting processes such that P0 is waiting for a resource that is held by P1, P1 is waiting for a resource that is held by P2, …, Pn–1 is waiting for a resource that is held by Pn, and Pn is waiting for a resource that is held by P0.

10. Networks and Distributed Systems
    A distributed system is a collection of loosely coupled nodes interconnected by a communications network.
    Nodes variously called processors, computers, machines, hosts.
      - Site is location of the machine, node refers to specific system
      - Generally a server has a resource a client node at a different site wants to use
