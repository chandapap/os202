#Top 10 list of Week 08
<br>

1. [Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm)<br>
The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particula strategy
Process scheduling is an essential part ofr a Multiprogramming operating systems. Such operating systems allow mor than one process to be loaded into the executable memory at a time and the loaded process shares the CPU using time multiplexing.

2. [CPU Burst & I/O Burst](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-CPU-Burst-and-I-O-Burst)<br>
CPU Burst it is the amount of time required by a process or can be said the amount of time requiredby the process to finish. We can not estimate the time taken by the process before running it. So most of the problem is related to the burst time.
I/O Burst it is While the process is in the running state, it may ask for i/o, thus the process goes to the block or wait state, where the i/o will be processed and then it will be sent back to the ready state.

3. [Algorithm : First Come First Serve](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html)<br>
First Come First Serve is the full form of FCFS. it is the easiest and most simple CPU scheduling algorithm. In this type algorithm,the process which requests the CPU gets the CPU allocation first. This scheduling method can be managed with a FIFO queue.
As the process enters the ready queue,its PCB(Process Control Block)is linked with the tail of the queue. So, when CPU becomes free, it should be assigned to the process at the beginning of the queue.

4. [Algorithm : Shortest Remaining Time First](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-shortest-remaining-time-first-srtf-algorithm/)<br>
is the preempetive version of Shortest Job Next(SJN) algorithm, where the processor is allocated to the job closest to completion.
This algorithm requires advanced concept and knowledge of CPU time required to process the job in an interactive system, and hence can't be implemented there. But ,in a batch system where it is desirable to give preference to short jobs,SRT algorithm is used.

5. [Algorithm : Priority Based Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm)<br>
Priority scheduling is a non preemptive algorithm and one of the most scheduling alogorithm in batch systems. Each process is assigned a priority. Process with highest prioriy is to be executed first and so on. Processes with same priority are executed on first come first served basis. Priority can be decided based on memory requirements, time requirements or any other resource requirement.

6. [Algorithm : Round Robin Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/round-robin-scheduling-example.html)<br>
The name of this algorithm comes from the round-robin principle,where each person gets an equal share of something in turns. It is the oldes,simplest scheduling algorithm, which is mostly used for multitasking.
In Round-robun scheduling,each ready task runs turn by turn only in a cyclic queue for a limitid time slice. This algorithm also offers starvation free execution of process.

7. [Algorithm : Shortest Job First](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/shortest-job-first)<br>
Shortest Job First scheduling works on the process with the shortes burst time orduration first.
It is of two types:
- Non Pre-emptive
- Pre-emptive

To successfully implement it,the burst time/duration time of the process should be known to the processor in advance, which is practically not feasible all the time.
This scheculing algorithm is optimal if all the jobs/processes are available at hte same time.(either Arrival time is 0 for all, or Arrival time is same for all)

8. [Algorithm : Multilevel Queue Scheduling](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/multilevel-queue-scheduling-in-operating-system.aspx)<br>
In the multilevel queue scheduling algorithm partition the ready queue has divided into seven separate queues. Based on some priority of the process;like memory size,process priority,or process type these processes are permanently assigned to one queue. Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm. For example,some queues are used for the foreground process and some for the background process.
The foreground queue can be scheduled by using a round-robin algorithm while the background queue is scheduled by a first come first serve algorithm.

9. [Thread Scheduling](https://www.iitk.ac.in/esc101/05Aug/tutorial/essential/threads/priority.html)<br>
Many computer configuration have a single CPU. Hence,threads run one at a time in such a way as to provide an illusion of concurency. Execution of multiple threads on a asingle CPU in some order is called scheduling. The Java runtime environment supports a very simple,deterministic scheduling algorithm called fixed-priority scheduling. This algorithm schedule threads on the basis of their priority relative to other Runnable threads.

10. [Real Time Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scheduling-in-real-time-systems/)<br>
Real-time systems are systems that carry real-time tasks. These tasks need to be performed immediately with a certain degree of urgency. In particular,thes tasks are related to control of certain events (or) reacting to them. Real-time tasks can be classified as hard real-time tasks and soft real-time tasks.
