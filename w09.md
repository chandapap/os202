#Top 10 list of Week 09
<br>

1. [Storage](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/storage-management/)<br>
Storage Management is defined as it refers to the management of the data storage equipments' that are used to store the user/computer generated data. Hence it is a tool or set of processes used by an administrator to keep your data and storage equipment's safe.
Storage management is a process for users to optimize the use of storage devices and to protect the integrity of data for any media on which it resides and the catagory of storage management generally contain the different type of subcatagories covering aspects such as security, virtualization and more,as well as different types of provisioning or automation, which  generally made up the entire storage management software market.

2. [Disk Formatting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-formatting/)<br>
Disk formatting is a process to configure the data-storage device such as hard-drive ,floppy disk and flash drive when we are going to use them for the very first time or we can say intial usage. Disk formatting is usually required when new operating system is going to be used y the user. it is also done when there is space issue and we require additional space for the storage of more data in the drives. When we format the disk then the existing files within the disk is also erased.
We can perform disk formatting on both magnetic platter hard-drives and solid-state drives.

3. [Boot Block](http://www.faadooengineers.com/online-study/post/cse/operating-system/275/boot-block)<br>
For a computer to start running for instance, when it is powered up or rebooted it must have an initial program to run. This initial bootstrap program ends to be simpel. It initializes all aspects of the system, from CPU registers to device controllers and the contents of main memory, and then starts the operating system. To do its job, the bootstrap program finds the operating system kernel on disk, loads that kernel into memory, and jumps to an initial address to begin the operating-system execution.
For most computers, the bootsrap is stored in read-only memory(ROM). THis location isconvinient,because ROM needs no initialization and is at a fixed location that the processor can start executing when powered up or reser. And since ROM is read only, it cannot be infected by computer virus. The problem is that changing this bootstrap code requires changing th ROM,hardware chips.

4. [Disk Partition](https://techterms.com/definition/partition)<br>
A partition is a section of a storage device, such as a hard disk drive or solid state drive. It is treated by the operating system as a separate logical volume, which makes it function similiar to a separate physical device.
A storage device may be formatted with one or more partitions. Some operating systems, such as windows and linux require multiple partitions, while others like macOs may only require one. Windows stores system files in a"System Partition" and user data files in data partition. Some Windows drives may also include a "Recovery Partition," which stores files used by the windows Recovery Environment(WinRe). This partition is used to repair problems that prevent the operating system from booting.

5. [Swap Space Management](https://tutorialspoint.dev/computer-science/operating-systems/operating-system-swap-space)<br>
A computer has sufficient amount of physical memory but most of times we need more so we swap some memory on disk. Swap space is a space on hard disk which is a substitute of physical memory . It is used as virtual memory which contains process memory image. Whenever our computer run short of physical memory it uses its virtual memory and stores information in memory on disk. Swap space helps the computers operating system in pretending that it have mor RAM than it actually has. It is also called as swapping and space on disk as "swap space"

6. [RAID](https://www.javatpoint.com/dbms-raid)<br>
RAID refers to redudancy array of the independent disk. It is a technology which is used to connect multiple secondary storage device for increased performance, data redudancy or both. It gives you the ability to survive one or more drive failure depending upon Raid level used.
It consists of an array of disks in which multiple disks are connected to achieve different goals.
There are 7 levels of RAID schemes. THese schemes are as RAID 0, RAID 1, ..., RAID 6.
These levels contain the following characteristics:
- It contains a set of physical disk drives
- In this technology, the operating system views these separate disks as a single logical disk.
- In this technology,data is distributed across the physical drives of the array.
- Redudancy disk capacity is used to store parity information.
- In case of disk failure, the parity information can be helped to recover data.

7. [Firmware](https://techterms.com/definition/firmware)<br>
Firmware is a software program or set of instructions programmed on a hardware device. It provides the necessary instructions for how the device communicates with the other computer hardware. Firmware is typically stored in the flash ROM of a hardware device. While ROM is "read-only memory," flash ROM can be erased and rewritten because it is actually a type of flash memory

8. [Operating system Boot Loader](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/configuration/what-is-a-bootloader/)<br>
A bootloader ,also known as a boot program or bootstrap loader, is a special operating system software that loads into the working memory of a computer after start-up. For this purpose, immediately after a device start, a bootloader is genereally launched by a bootable medium like a hard drive, a CD/DVD or a USB stick. The boot medium receives information from the computer's firmware abput where the bootloader is. The whole process is also described as "booting"

9. [BIOS](https://www.lifewire.com/bios-basic-input-output-system-2625820)<br>
Bios, which stands for Basic Input Output System is software stored on a small memory chip on the motherboard. It's BIOS that's responsible for the POST and therefore makes it the very first software to run when a computer is started.
The BIOS firmware is non-volatile, meaning that its settings are saved and recoverable even after power has been removed from the device.
BIOS instruct the computer on how to perform basic functions such as booting and keyboard control.
BIOS is also used to identify and configure the hardware in a computer such as the hard drive, floppy drive, optical drive, CPU, memory, and related equipment.

10. [UEFI](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Unified-Extensible-Firmware-Interface-UEFI)<br>
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a specifition for a software program that connects a computer's firmware to its operating system (OS). UEFI is expected to eventually replace BIOS.
Like BIOS, UEFI is installed at the time of manufacturing and is the first program that runs when a computer is turned on. It checks to see what hardware components the computing device has, wakes the components up and hands them over to the operating system. The new specification addresses several limitation of BIOS including restrictions on hard disk partition size and the amount of time BIOS takes to perform its tasks.
