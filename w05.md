#Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Virtual Memory](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/virtual-memory)<br>
Virtual Memory is a space where large programs can store themselves in form of pages while their executioon and only the required pages or portions of processes are loaded into the main memory. This technique is useful as large virtual memory is provided for user programs when a very small physical memory is there. in real scenarios, most processes never need all their pages at once, for following reasons :
- Error handling code is not needed unless that specific error occurs, some of which are quite rare.
- Arrays are often over-sized for worst-case scenarios, and only a small fraction of the arrays are actually used in practice.
- Certain features of certain programs are rarely used.

2. [Demand Paging](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)<br>
A demand paging system is quite similiar to a paging system with swapping where processes reside in secondary memory and pages are loaded only on demand, not in advance. When a context switch occurs, the operating system does not copy any of the old program's pages out to the disk or any of the new program's pages into the main memory instead, it just begins executing the new program after loading the first page and fetches that program's pages as they are referenced. While executing a program, if the program references a page which is not available in the main memory because it was swapped out a little ago, the processor treats this invalid memory reference as a page fault and transfers control from the program to the operating system to demand the page back into the memory.
