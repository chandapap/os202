#Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Virtual Memory](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/virtual-memory)<br>
Virtual Memory is a space where large programs can store themselves in form of pages while their executioon and only the required pages or portions of processes are loaded into the main memory. This technique is useful as large virtual memory is provided for user programs when a very small physical memory is there. in real scenarios, most processes never need all their pages at once, for following reasons :
- Error handling code is not needed unless that specific error occurs, some of which are quite rare.
- Arrays are often over-sized for worst-case scenarios, and only a small fraction of the arrays are actually used in practice.
- Certain features of certain programs are rarely used.

2. [Demand Paging](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)<br>
A demand paging system is quite similiar to a paging system with swapping where processes reside in secondary memory and pages are loaded only on demand, not in advance. When a context switch occurs, the operating system does not copy any of the old program's pages out to the disk or any of the new program's pages into the main memory instead, it just begins executing the new program after loading the first page and fetches that program's pages as they are referenced. While executing a program, if the program references a page which is not available in the main memory because it was swapped out a little ago, the processor treats this invalid memory reference as a page fault and transfers control from the program to the operating system to demand the page back into the memory.

3. [Page Replacement](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-page-replacement-algorithms)<br>
The page replecement algorithm decides which memory page is to be replaced. The process of replecment is sometimes called swap out or write to disk. Page replacement is done when requested page is not found in the main memory (page failt). There are two main aspects of virtual memory, Frame allocation and Page Repalaement. It is very important to have the optimal frame allocation and page replacement algorith. Frame allocation is all about how many frames are to be allocated to the process while the page replacement is all about determining the page number which needs to be replaced in order to make space for the requested page.

4. [Page Replacement Algorithm : FIFO](https://technobyte.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-os/)<br>
This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps a track of all the pages present in the memory in a queue fashion. When a page needs to be replaced, the oldes page in the queue is selected and replaced with the new page. For instance, let's suppose we have a page reference string as(1,3,0,3,5,6,3) with theree-page frames. Initially, all the slots are empty so the first three reference strings (1,3,0) will be allocated to the empty slots with 3 page-faults.

5. [Page Replacement Algorithm : Optimal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/optimal-page-replacement-algorithm/)<br>
In operating systems, whenever a new page is referred and not present in memory,page fault occurs and Operating Systems replaces one of the existing pages with newly needed page. Different page replecement algorithms suggest different ways to decide which page to replace. The target for all algorithm is to reduce number of page faults. In this algorithm, OS replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in future. 

6. [Page Replacement Algorithm : LRU](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-least-recently-used-lru-page-replacement-algorithm/)<br>
In operating systems that use paging for memory management, page replacement algorithm are needed to decide which page needed to be replaced when new page comes in. Whenever a new page is referred and not present in memory, page fault occurs and Operating System replaces one of the existing pages with newly needed page. Different page replacement algorithms suggest different ways to decide which page to replace. The target for all algorithms is to reduce number of page faults. In Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm is a Greedy algorithm whrere the page to replaced is least recently used. The idea is based on locality of reference, the least recently used page is not likely.

7. [Page Buffering Algorithm](http://productdevelop.blogspot.com/2010/01/page-buffering-algorithm.html)<br>
There are some other procedures that are often used in addition to a specific page replacement algorithm. System commonly keep a pool of frames. When a page fault occurs, a victim frame is chosen as before. However, the desired page is read into a free frame from the pool before the victim is written out. This procedure allows the process to restart as soon as possible, without waiting for the victim page to be written out. When the victim is later written out, its frame is added to the free-frame pool.

8. [Allocation of Frames](https://basicittopic.com/allocation-of-frames/)<br>
When a page fault occurs, there is a free frame available to store a new page into a frame. While the page swap is taking place, a replacement can be selected, which is written to the disk as the user process continues to execute. The operating system allocates all its buffer and tablespace from the free-frame list for the new page.Two major allocation Allgorithm/schemes.
- Equal allocation
- Proportional allocation

9. [Trashing](http://epgp.inflibnet.ac.in/epgdata/uploads/epgp_content/S000007CS/P001062/M023214/ET/1505906400frameallocation-thrashing-os29-etextQ1.pdf)<br>
If a process does not have enough frames, the page-fault rate is very high. if all allocated pages are active page repalcement will lead to more page faults. Suppose a process is allocated 5 frames and all pages are active. If there is a page fault now for that process, one of the 5 active frames is moved out and the required page is brought in. Since the page that is moved out is an active page, the moved out page may be needed immediately. There is a page fault again and another active page is moved out to bring in the required page. This leads to page faults again and again.

10. [Slab Allocator](https://www.kernel.org/doc/gorman/html/understand/understand011.html)<br>
The basic idea behind the slab allocator is tho have caches of commonly used objects kept in an initialised state available for use by the kernel. Without an object based allocator, the kernel will spend much of its time allocating, initialising and freeing the same object. The slab allocator aims to to cache the freed object so that the basic structure is preserved between uses. The slab allocator consists of a variable number of caches that are linked together on doubly linked circular list called a cache chain. A cache, in the context of the slab allocator, is a manager for a number of objects of a particular type like the mm_struct or fs_cache cache and is managed by a struct kmem_cache_s discussed in detail later. The caches are linked via the next field in the cache struct.
