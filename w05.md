#Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Virtual Memory](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/virtual-memory)<br>
Virtual Memory is a space where large programs can store themselves in form of pages while their executioon and only the required pages or portions of processes are loaded into the main memory. This technique is useful as large virtual memory is provided for user programs when a very small physical memory is there. in real scenarios, most processes never need all their pages at once, for following reasons :
- Error handling code is not needed unless that specific error occurs, some of which are quite rare.
- Arrays are often over-sized for worst-case scenarios, and only a small fraction of the arrays are actually used in practice.
- Certain features of certain programs are rarely used.

2. [Demand Paging](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)<br>
A demand paging system is quite similiar to a paging system with swapping where processes reside in secondary memory and pages are loaded only on demand, not in advance. When a context switch occurs, the operating system does not copy any of the old program's pages out to the disk or any of the new program's pages into the main memory instead, it just begins executing the new program after loading the first page and fetches that program's pages as they are referenced. While executing a program, if the program references a page which is not available in the main memory because it was swapped out a little ago, the processor treats this invalid memory reference as a page fault and transfers control from the program to the operating system to demand the page back into the memory.

3. [Page Replacement](https://www.javatpoint.com/ose-page-replecement-algorithms)<br>
The page replecement algorithm decides which memory page is to be replaced. The process of replecment is sometimes called swap out or write to disk. Page replacement is done when requested page is not found in the main memory (page failt). There are two main aspects of virtual memory, Frame allocation and Page Repalaement. It is very important to have the optimal frame allocation and page replacement algorith. Frame allocation is all about how many frames are to be allocated to the process while the page replacement is all about determining the page number which needs to be replaced in order to make space for the requested page.

4. [Page Replacement Algorithm : FIFO](https://technobyte.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-os/)<br>
This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps a track of all the pages present in the memory in a queue fashion. When a page needs to be replaced, the oldes page in the queue is selected and replaced with the new page. For instance, let's suppose we have a page reference string as(1,3,0,3,5,6,3) with theree-page frames. Initially, all the slots are empty so the first three reference strings (1,3,0) will be allocated to the empty slots with 3 page-faults.

5. [Page Replacement Algorithm : Optimal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/optimal-page-replecement-algorithm/)<br>
In operating systems, whenever a new page is referred and not present in memory,page fault occurs and Operating Systems replaces one of the existing pages with newly needed page. Different page replecement algorithms suggest different ways to decide which page to replace. The target for all algorithm is to reduce number of page faults. In this algorithm, OS replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in future. 

6. [Page Replecement Algorithm : LRU](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-least-recently-used-lru-page-replacement-algorithm/)<br>
In operating systems that use paging for memory management, page replacement algorithm are needed to decide which page needed to be replaced when new page comes in. Whenever a new page is referred and not present in memory, page fault occurs and Operating System replaces one of the existing pages with newly needed page. Different page replacement algorithms suggest different ways to decide which page to replace. The target for all algorithms is to reduce number of page faults. In Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm is a Greedy algorithm whrere the page to replaced is least recently used. The idea is based on locality of reference, the least recently used page is not likely.
