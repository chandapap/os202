#Top 10 list of Week 06
<br>
1.[Concurrency](https://sceweb.uhcl.edu/helm/RationalUnifiedProcess/process/workflow/ana_desi/co_cncry.htm)<br>
Concurrency is the tendency for things to happen at the same time in a system. Concurrency is a natural phenomenon, of course. In the real worllld, at any given time, many things are happening simultaneously. When we design software to monitor and control real-world systems, we must deal with this natural concurrency.
When ddealing with concurrency issues in software systems, there are generally two aspects that are important: being able to detect and respond to external events occuring in random order, and ensuring that these events are responded to in some minimum required intervval.

2.[Process Concept](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes.htm)<br>
A process is basically a program in execution. The execution of a process must in a sequential fashion. A process is defined as an entity which represents the basic unit of work to be implemented in the system.
To put in simple terms, we write our computer programs in a text file and when we execute this program, it becomes a process which performs all the tasks mentioned in the program.
When a program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a process, it can be divided intoo four sections - stack, heap, text and data.

3.[Process Creation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-creation-vs-process-termination-in-operating-system)<br>
A proces may be created in the system for different operations. Some of the events that lead to process creation are as follows - 
- User request for process creation
- System Initialization
- Batch job initialization
- Execution of a process creation system call by a running process
A process may be created by another process using fork(). The creating process is called the parent process and the created process is the child process. A child process can have only one parent but a parent process may have many children.

4.[Process Termination](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-creation-vs-process-termination-in-operating-system)<br>
Process termination occures when the process is terminated The exit() system call is used by most operating systems for process termiation.
Some of the causes of process termination are as follows
- A process may be terminated after its execution is naturally completed. This process leaves the processor and releases all its resources.
- A child process may be terminated if its parent process requests for its termination.
- A process can be terminated if it tries to use a resource that it is not allowed to.
if an I/O failure occures for a process, it can be terminated. For example - if a process requires the printer and it is not working, then the process will be terminated.

5.[Process State](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/operating-system-processes#)<br>
Processes in the operating system can be in any of the following states:
- New = The process is being created.
- Ready = The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
- Running = Instructions are being executed.
- Waiting = The process is waiting for some event to occur(such as an I/O completion or reception of a signal).
- Terminated = The process has finished execution.

6.[Process Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/process-scheduling.html#1)<br>
Process Scheduling is an OS task that schedules process of different states like ready,waiting, and running.
Process scheduling allows OS to allocate a time interval of CPU execution for each process. Another important reason for using a process scheduling system is that it keeps the CPU busy all the time. This allows you to get the minimum response time for programs.

7.[Inter Process Communication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/)<br>
A process can be of two types:
- Independent process.
- Co-operating process.

An independent process is not affected by the execution of other processes while a co-operating process can be affected by other executing processes. Though one can think that those processes,which are running independently, will execute very efficiently, in reality, there are many situations when co-operative nature can be utilised for increasing computational speed, convinience and modularity. Inter process communication(IPC) is a mechanism which allows processes to communicate with each other and synchronize their actions. The communication between these processes can be seen as a methode of co-operation between them.

8.[IPC Model:Shared memory system](https://binaryterms.com/shared-memory-system-in-ipc.html)<br>
Operating system strictly restricts one process to share the memory of the other process. But sometimes processes need to interact and share data. And for this we have to set an environment where the cooperating processes can exchange data or information with each othe
In the shared memory system, the cooperating process which wants to initiate the communication establishes a region of shared memory in its address space. The other cooperative process which requires the shared data has to attach itself to the address space of the initiating process.

9.[IPC Model:Message Passing](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/242/s07/notes/ipc/node4.html)<br>
The most pupular form of interprocess communication involves message passing. Processes communicate with each other by exchanging messages. A process may send information to a port, from which another process may receive information. The sending and receiving processes can be on the same or different computers connected via a communication medium.
One reason for the popularity of message passing is its ability to support client-server interaction. A server is a process that offers a set of services to client processes.These services are invoked in response to messages from the clients and results are returned in messages to the client. Thus a process may act as a web search sever by accepting messages that ask it to searchthe web for a string.

10.[Thread](https://medium.com/@kiyoungju/operating-system-4-threads-7b63185b12e8)<br>
A thread is a basic unit of GPU utilization; it comprises a thread ID, a program counter, a register set, and a stack. A traditional, or heacyweight, process has a single thread of control. If a process has multiple thread of control, it can perform more than one task at a time.
For example, a word processor may have a thread for displaying graphics, another thread fforresponding to keystrokes form the user, and a third thread for performing spelling and grammar checking in the background.
Another popular example is multo-threaded web server. A traditional singlepthreaded process can not listen to client requests while it processing other jobs, which makes performance very slow. In a multithreaded server, it will create a separate thread that listens for client requests.
