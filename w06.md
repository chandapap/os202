#Top 10 list of Week 06
1.[Concurrency](https://sceweb.uhcl.edu/helm/RationalUnifiedProcess/process/workflow/ana_desi/co_cncry.htm)<br>
Concurrency is the tendency for things to happen at the same time in a system. Concurrency is a natural phenomenon, of course. In the real worllld, at any given time, many things are happening simultaneously. When we design software to monitor and control real-world systems, we must deal with this natural concurrency.
When ddealing with concurrency issues in software systems, there are generally two aspects that are important: being able to detect and respond to external events occuring in random order, and ensuring that these events are responded to in some minimum required intervval.

2.[Process Concept](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes.htm)<br>
A process is basically a program in execution. The execution of a process must in a sequential fashion. A process is defined as an entity which represents the basic unit of work to be implemented in the system.
To put in simple terms, we write our computer programs in a text file and when we execute this program, it becomes a process which performs all the tasks mentioned in the program.
When a program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a process, it can be divided intoo four sections - stack, heap, text and data.

3.[Process Creation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-creation-vs-process-termination-in-operating-system)<br>
A proces may be created in the system for different operations. Some of the events that lead to process creation are as follows - 
- User request for process creation
- System Initialization
- Batch job initialization
- Execution of a process creation system call by a running process
A process may be created by another process using fork(). The creating process is called the parent process and the created process is the child process. A child process can have only one parent but a parent process may have many children.

4.[Process Termination](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-creation-vs-process-termination-in-operating-system)<br>
Process termination occures when the process is terminated The exit() system call is used by most operating systems for process termiation.
Some of the causes of process termination are as follows
- A process may be terminated after its execution is naturally completed. This process leaves the processor and releases all its resources.
- A child process may be terminated if its parent process requests for its termination.
- A process can be terminated if it tries to use a resource that it is not allowed to.
if an I/O failure occures for a process, it can be terminated. For example - if a process requires the printer and it is not working, then the process will be terminated.
