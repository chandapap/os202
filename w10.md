#Top 10 list of Week 10
<br>

1. [Direct I/O](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/global_file_system/s1-manage-direct-io)<br>
Direct I/O is a feature of the file system whereby file reads and writes go directly from the aplications to the storage device,bypassing the operating system read and write caches. Direct I/O is used only by application(such as databases) thah manage their own caches.
An aplication invokes direct I/O by opening a file with the 0_Direct flag. Alternatively,GFS can attach a direct I/O attribute to a file, in which case direct I/O us used regardless of how the file is opened.

2. [Memory Mapped I/O](http://www.cs.uwm.edu/classes/cs315/Bacon/Lecture/HTML/ch14s03.html)<br>
From the CPU's perspective, an I/O devie appears as a set of special-purpose registers, of three general types:
- Status registers provide status information to the CPU about the I/O device. These registers are often read-only, i.e. the CPU can only read their bits, and cannot change them.
- Configuration/control registers are used by the CPU to configure and control the device. Bits in thes configuration registers may be write-only, so the CPU can alter them, but not read them back. Most bits in control registers can be both read and written.
- Data registers are used to read data from or send data to he I/O device.

3. [NON-Maskable Interrupts](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_real_time/7/html/reference_guide/non-maskable_interrupts)<br>
An interrupt is said to be masked when it has been disabled, or when the CPU has been instructed to ignore it. A non-maskable interrupt(NMI) cannot be ignored, and is generally used only for critical hardware errors.
NMIs are normally delivered over a separate interrupt line. When an NMI is received by the CPU, it indicates that a critical error has occurred,and that system is probably about to crash. The NMI is generally the best indication of what might have caused the problem.

4. [Maskable Interrupts](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-maskable-and-non-maskable-interrupt/)<br>
An Interrupt that can be disabled or ignored by the instructions of CPU are called as Maskable Interrupt. The interrputs are either edge-triggered or level-triggered 

5. [Direct Memory Access](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2767/direct-memory-access-dma)<br>
A defined portion of memory is used to send data directly from a peripheral to the motherboard without involving the microprocessor, so that the process does not interfere with overall computer operation.
In older computers, four DMA channels were numbered 0,1,2 and 3. When the 16-bit industry standard architecture(ISA) expansion bus was introduced,channels 5,6 and 7 were added.
ISA was a computer bus standard for IBM-compatibel computers, allowing a device to initiate transactions(bus mastering) at a quicker speed. The ISA DMA controller has 8 DMA channels,each one of which associated with a 16-bit address and count registers.

6. [I/O Structure](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_io_software.htm)<br>
I/O software is often organized in the following layers -
- User Level Libraries - This provides simple interface to the user program to perform input and output. For example, stdio is a library provided by C and C++ programming languages.
- Kernel Level Modules - This provides device driver to interact with the device controller and device independent I/O modules used by the device drivers.
- Hardware - This layer includes actual hardware and hardware controller which interact with the device drivers makes hardware alive.

7. [I/O Streams](https://datacadamia.com/io/stream)<br>
Stream I/O refers to the transfer of data either to or from a storage medium. Streams are mean to manipulate the data that is read or written from and to a file(from byte to characters,object,..).
For instance, a file content is an ordered collection of bytes and you manipulate this sequence of byte through the creation of a stream that gives you methods to read from and write to and from destinations such as:
- a hardware device (disk,memory)
- a file
- a network socket
- or a program component
