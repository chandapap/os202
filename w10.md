#Top 10 list of Week 10
<br>

1. [Direct I/O](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/global_file_system/s1-manage-direct-io)<br>
Direct I/O is a feature of the file system whereby file reads and writes go directly from the aplications to the storage device,bypassing the operating system read and write caches. Direct I/O is used only by application(such as databases) thah manage their own caches.
An aplication invokes direct I/O by opening a file with the 0_Direct flag. Alternatively,GFS can attach a direct I/O attribute to a file, in which case direct I/O us used regardless of how the file is opened.

2. [Memory Mapped I/O](http://www.cs.uwm.edu/classes/cs315/Bacon/Lecture/HTML/ch14s03.html)<br>
From the CPU's perspective, an I/O devie appears as a set of special-purpose registers, of three general types:
- Status registers provide status information to the CPU about the I/O device. These registers are often read-only, i.e. the CPU can only read their bits, and cannot change them.
- Configuration/control registers are used by the CPU to configure and control the device. Bits in thes configuration registers may be write-only, so the CPU can alter them, but not read them back. Most bits in control registers can be both read and written.
- Data registers are used to read data from or send data to he I/O device.

3. [NON-Maskable Interrupts](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_real_time/7/html/reference_guide/non-maskable_interrupts)
