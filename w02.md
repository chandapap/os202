Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Virtual Machine]
    - A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. 
      In other words, creating a computer within a computer. It runs in a window, much like any other program, giving the end user the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on the host operating system itself. 
      The virtual machine is sandboxed from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a virtual machine can’t escape or tamper with the computer itself. This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems including beta releases, accessing virus-infected data, creating operating system backups, and running software or applications on operating systems they weren’t originally intended for.
      Multiple virtual machines can run simultaneously on the same physical computer. For servers, the multiple operating systems run side-by-side with a piece of software called a hypervisor to manage them, while desktop computers typical employ one operating system to run the other operating systems within its program windows. Each virtual machine provides its own virtual hardware, including CPUs, memory, hard drives, network interfaces, and other devices. 
      The virtual hardware is then mapped to the real hardware on the physical machine which saves costs by reducing the need for physical hardware systems along with the associated maintenance costs that go with it, plus reduces power and cooling demand.
      
2. [Opensource Software]
    - Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
      "Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. 
      Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.

3. Unix Command
    - Unix commands are inbuilt programs that can be invoked in multiple ways. Here, we will work with these commands interactively from a Unix terminal. A Unix terminal is a graphical program that provides a command-line interface using a shell program.

4. AWK
    - Awk is a scripting language used for manipulating data and generating reports.The awk command programming language requires no compiling, and allows the user to use variables, numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators. 
      Awk is a utility that enables a programmer to write tiny but effective programs in the form of statements that define text patterns that are to be searched for in each line of a document and the action that is to be taken when a match is found within a line. Awk is mostly used for pattern scanning and processing. It searches one or more files to see if they contain lines that matches with the specified patterns and then performs the associated actions.
      Awk is abbreviated from the names of the developers – Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan.

5. Vi Editor
    - The VI editor is the most popular and classic text editor in the Linux family. Below, are some reasons which make it a widely used editor –
      1) It is available in almost all Linux Distributions
      2) It works the same across different platforms and Distributions
      3) It is user-friendly. Hence, millions of Linux users love it and use it for their editing needs

6. Regex
    - A regular expression is a special text string for describing a search pattern. You can think of regular expressions as wildcards on steroids. You are probably familiar with wildcard notations such as *.txt to find all text files in a file manager. The regex equivalent is .*\.txt. 
      But you can do much more with regular expressions. In a text editor like EditPad Pro or a specialized text processing tool like PowerGREP, you could use the regular expression \b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,6}\b to search for an email address. Any email address, to be exact. A very similar regular expression can be used by a programmer to check if the user entered a properly formatted email address. In just one line of code, whether that code is written in Perl, PHP, Java, a .NET language or a multitude of other languages.
      Since “regular expressions” is a mouthful, you will usually find the term abbreviated as “regex” or “regexp”. We prefer “regex”, since it can be easily pluralized as “regexes”.

7. Stream Editor
    - A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline). While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient. But it is sed’s ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.

8. Public Key
    - In cryptography, a public key is a large numerical value that is used to encrypt data. The key can be generated by a software program, but more often, it is provided by a trusted, designated authority and made available to everyone through a publicly accessible repository or directory.
      A private key is another large numerical value that is mathematically linked to the public key. In asymmetric cryptography, whatever is encrypted with a public key may only be decrypted by its corresponding private key and vice versa.

9. SSH Connect
    - The SSH protocol (also referred to as Secure Shell) is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. It provides several alternative options for strong authentication, and it protects the communications security and integrity with strong encryption. It is a secure alternative to the non-protected login protocols (such as telnet, rlogin) and insecure file transfer methods (such as FTP).
    
10. Generating Key
    - Key generation is the process of generating keys for cryptography. The key is used to encrypt and decrypt data whatever the data is being encrypted or decrypted.
      Modern cryptographic systems include symmetric-key algorithms (such as DES and AES) and public-key algorithms (such as RSA). Symmetric-key algorithms use a single shared key; keeping data secret requires keeping this key secret. Public-key algorithms use a public key and a private key. The public key is made available to anyone (often by means of a digital certificate). A sender will encrypt data with the public key; only the holder of the private key can decrypt this data.
      Since public-key algorithms tend to be much slower than symmetric-key algorithms, modern systems such as TLS and its predecessor SSL as well as the SSH use a combination of the two in which:
      1. One party receives the other's public key, and encrypts a small piece of data (either a symmetric key or some data that will be used to generate it).
      2. The remainder of the conversation (the remaining party) uses a (typically faster) symmetric-key algorithm for encryption.
